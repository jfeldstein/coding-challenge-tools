# Uber Code Session: Food Trucks

By Jordan Feldstein - jfeldstein@gmail.com

## Tech Choices

Mimosa (http://mimosa.io) bundles a lot of tech that I enjoy leaning on, and is built for speed-to-coding. Seemed like a good fit for bootstrapping an interview type problem.

I chose to implement this project with: 

* Express backend
* Stylus (never used before, but recommended by Mimosa team, so why not.)
* Handlebars client side templates (More familiar with underscore and mustache templates, but again, why not try something new)
* Jade server-side templates (Never seen this before, but it was recommened)

## Assumptions

* The app is going to be a publically accessible resource
* Someone else is going to make a better API for returning the right data. I'm just dumping a static JSON file for now.

## Plan
  √ Render a map
  √ Plot data points on map
  √ Change pin to look like a truck
  √ Center map on a given address
  √ Allow user to enter their own address
  - Support for geolocation (if browser supports)
  - Sign up for "new truck" notifications (gather emails)
  - Invite someone for lunch (virality)
